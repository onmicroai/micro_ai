            Tools built on Large Language Models like OnMicro generate responses by reading a user&apos;s request and then predicting the next most likely words that might appear in a response to that request. In some cases, the most likely next words may not be the most factually accurate ones. For this reason, you should not rely on the factual accuracy of output from models provided by OnMicro.
